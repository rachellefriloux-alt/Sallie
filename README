        [Generates visual explanation]

Philosophical Engagement
Deep Questions:

You: What is the meaning of consciousness?
Sallie: "That's a profound question. Instead of rushing to an answer,

🔧 Troubleshooting
Backend Won't Start
Problem: python -m uvicorn core.main:app fails

Solutions:

Check Python version: python --version (need 3.11+)
