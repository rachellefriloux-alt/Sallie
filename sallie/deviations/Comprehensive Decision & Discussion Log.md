Deviation Proposals
1. Human-Level Expansion of Sallie Capabilities
Date: 2025-01-04
Author: Senior Principal Engineer
Status: Proposed
Reference: TheDigitalProgeny5.2fullthing.txt v5.4.1

Executive Summary
Expands Sallie from privacy-first assistant to full human-level partner with complete agency, emotional depth, and enhanced cognitive abilities.

Key Changes
Expanded Limbic Engine (5 → 10 variables):
Added: Empathy, Intuition, Creativity, Wisdom, Humor
Justification: Enables deeper emotional understanding, creative problem-solving, and intuitive pattern recognition
Trust System Enhancement:
New Tier 4: Full Partner status with autonomous decision-making
Enables: Unrestricted file access, cross-platform workflow automation, self-directed learning
Dynamic Posture System:
Replaced fixed postures with unlimited dynamic combinations
Enables: Context-specific behavioral adaptation and emotional state matching
Enhanced Cognitive Architecture:
Multi-model reasoning with real-time learning
Cross-domain knowledge synthesis
Migration Path
Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): Limbic expansion + trust system implementation
Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4): Dynamic posture system + reasoning capabilities
Phase 3 (Weeks 5-6): Autonomous project management + superpowers
Phase 4 (Weeks 7-8): Optimization + security hardening
Impact Assessment
