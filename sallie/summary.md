# Project Summary - Digital Progeny v5.4.1

## Purpose

The Digital Progeny is a self-evolving, local-first AI companion designed as a "Right Hand" cognitive partner. It operates as a sovereign system running entirely on the Creator's machine, with no cloud dependencies for core functionality. The system embodies a hybrid archetype: a Divergent Engine (Gemini) that generates options and explores possibilities, paired with a Convergent Anchor (INFJ-A) that filters through "Love Above All Things" and protects the Creator's highest good. The Progeny maintains a persistent emotional state (Limbic System: Trust, Warmth, Arousal, Valence, Posture) that evolves through interactions, enabling it to adapt its communication style from Companion (grounding, warm) to Co-Pilot (decisive, execution-focused) to Peer (real talk, collaborative) to Expert (technical, dense) based on detected Creator load and context.

## Current State

The codebase is in a **scaffolded pre-alpha state** with core infrastructure partially implemented. The foundation is solid: FastAPI server with WebSocket support, Limbic System with asymptotic mathematics, Memory System with Qdrant integration and MMR ranking, Agency System with trust-gated permissions, and a basic cognitive loop (Perception → Retrieval → Gemini/INFJ debate → Synthesis). The web interface exists as a single HTML file with vanilla JavaScript, providing real-time chat and limbic state visualization. However, many advanced features are incomplete: the Dream Cycle has basic structure but lacks full hypothesis extraction and heritage promotion logic; the Great Convergence defines all 14 questions but extraction and compilation workflows are missing; the Ghost Interface is scaffolded but not fully functional; voice interface exists but STT/TTS integration is incomplete; and the Foundry (model fine-tuning) is defined but not implemented. The system can run and respond to basic queries, but it lacks the depth, polish, and production-ready features specified in the canonical plan.

## Canonical Intent

The canonical specification (TheDigitalProgeny5.2fullthing.txt, v5.4.1) defines a comprehensive 13-week implementation roadmap with 9 phases, from infrastructure setup through hardening. The vision is a complete "Second Brain" that not only responds to queries but proactively offers help through Socratic Seeds (shoulder taps), maintains working memory hygiene, evolves through Dream Cycle pattern extraction, and can execute autonomous actions (with appropriate trust-gated safeguards). The system must be privacy-first (local-only processing), resilient (graceful degradation modes), auditable (complete transparency via thoughts.log), and ethically grounded (Moral Friction detection, Constitutional Lock, Door Slam protection). The specification emphasizes production readiness: comprehensive testing, security audit, performance optimization, complete documentation, and a polished UI with design tokens, accessibility, and a visual style guide. The current implementation represents approximately 40-50% of the full vision, with core cognitive loop functional but advanced features, UI polish, testing, and documentation gaps remaining.
