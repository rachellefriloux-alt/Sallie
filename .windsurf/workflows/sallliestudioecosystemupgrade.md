SALLIE STUDIO ECOSYSTEM UPGRADE PROJECT

Project Overview:

Senior Principal Engineer responsible for upgrading entire Sallie Studio ecosystem
Multi-platform: Windows desktop (flagship), web, mobile
Backend runs on local mini PC at http://192.168.1.47:8742
Privacy-first, local-first architecture with optional remote access
Brand identity: Louisiana culture, duality, peacock/leopard, Gemini/INFJ
Reference Document:

docs/1111111111111111111.txt is the authoritative source of truth
Must compare all changes against this document
Must get explicit approval before any modifications
Key Requirements:

Ingest entire multi-platform codebase and build architectural map
Deep architectural review (modularity, scalability, LAN/remote access)
Full code review for all platforms (bugs, anti-patterns, security)
Refactor to top-tier engineering standards
Fix ALL errors
Upgrade and update everything
Implement dual-mode connectivity (LAN + Remote)
Add optional enhancements aligned with philosophy
Ensure all components connected correctly
Deliver production-ready final version
Current State Assessment:

Backend URL configuration needs updating (localhost vs 192.168.1.47:8742)
Some missing integration points between platforms
Dependency updates needed across all platforms
Dual-mode connectivity not fully implemented
Some components reference non-existent files
Platforms:

Windows Desktop: WinUI 3 with WebView2 integration
Web: React/Next.js application
Mobile: React Native application
Backend: Python FastAPI with Docker services
Next Steps:

Create comprehensive comparison matrix vs reference document
Perform architectural mapping and code review
Implement dual-mode connectivity
Upgrade dependencies and fix errors
Refactor and modernize codebase
Final integration testing and documentation
